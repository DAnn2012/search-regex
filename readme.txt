Search Regex adds a powerful set of search and replace functions to WordPress posts, pages, custom post types, and other data sources.

== Description ==

Search Regex adds a powerful set of search and replace functions to WordPress posts, pages, custom post types, and other data sources. These go beyond the standard searching capabilities, and allow you to search and replace almost any data stored on your site. In addition to simple searches you have the full power of PHP's regular expressions at your disposal.

You can use this to do things like:
- Help migrate a site from one domain to another
- Update URLs in links and images
- Perform site-wide changes
